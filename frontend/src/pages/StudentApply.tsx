          <p>
            Most students spend about 3 to 5 hours per week on Hack4Impact-UMD project work. Each project team
            determines their own schedule, but most meet for about 1 hour per week to plan and delegate tasks. The other
            time is spent working on the project individually. <br /> <br />
            We also hold mandatory general body meetings every month, which are about 1 hour long. Hack4Impact-UMD holds
            many other events during the year, such as volunteer events, tech talks, and social events. These events are
            not required, but we highly encourage our members to attend. <br /> <br />
            Leadership roles, such as executive directors, project managers, and tech leads will spend more time, up to
            10 hours a week.{' '}

        answer={
          <p>
            It is not required to know any specific languages, but we do require students who are applying to become
            developers or tech leads to have taken CMSC 131 or have basic programming skills (classes, arrays, maps,
            etc.) already. <br /> <br />
            General web development skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also good to know. <br /> <br />
            People with less programming and web development experience will be placed in the bootcamp group, which will
            allow you to get to know other people in Hack4Impact-UMD, improve your web development skills, and
            understand the team dynamics in developer team. <br /> <br />
            Roles like the Sourcing Commitee Member do not require any technical background.

            We mainly develop new projects on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack. However, we will
            also help out nonprofit organizations that have existing websites on other stacks, such as Django, Flask, or
            Ruby on Rails.
