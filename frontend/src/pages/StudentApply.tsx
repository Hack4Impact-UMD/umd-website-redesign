        answer={
          <p>
            Most students spend about 3 hours per week on Hack4Impact project work. Each project team determines their
            own schedule, but most meet for about 1 hour per week to plan and delegate tasks. The other time is spent
            working on the project individually. <br /> <br />
            We also hold general body meetings every week, which are about 1 hour long. H4I holds many other events
            during the year, such as volunteer events, tech talks, and social events. These events are not mandatory,
            but we highly encourage our members to attend. <br /> <br /> Leadership roles, such as executive directors,
            project managers, and tech leads will spend more time, up to 10 hours a week.{' '}

      />
      <FaqRow question={<p>Do I need any prior technical experience before applying?</p>} answer={<p>
        It is not required to know any specific languages, but we do require students who are applying to become developers or product managers to have taken CMSC 131 or have basic programming skills (classes, arrays, maps, etc.) already. General web development skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also good to know. People with less programming and web development experience will be placed in the bootcamp group, which will allow you to get to know other people in Hack4Impact and improve your web development skills.</p>} />
      <FaqRow question={<p>What tech stack is used in your projects?</p>} answer={<p>We mainly develop new projects on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack. However, we will also help out nonprofit organizations that have existing websites on other stacks, such as Django, Flask, or Ruby on Rails.</p>} />
