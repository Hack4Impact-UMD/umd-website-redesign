# Features and Best Practices to Use:
### CSS Modules
###   - has local scope by default, which we like
###   - makes sure that style applies to only the component and nothing else
###   - Avoid using CSS expressions or functions like calc(), it slows down the page, use attributes like box-sizing instead

### Prettier
###   - Use Prettier in VSCode for consistent style throughout your code.

### Avoid using global variables
