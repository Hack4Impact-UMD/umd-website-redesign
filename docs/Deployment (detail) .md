- deployed with netlify, ([https://app.netlify.com/sites/resonant-begonia-90fe13/deploys](https://app.netlify.com/sites/resonant-begonia-90fe13/deploys))
- command is `yarn build` ; and an env variable `[CI = false](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/#declare-variables)` ; note. [you should probably change CI to be true](https://answers.netlify.com/t/new-ci-true-build-configuration-treating-warnings-as-errors-because-process-env-ci-true/14434)/ get rid of the warnings. it currently deployed with warnings for speed
